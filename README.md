# Face Matching

This project, developed with VS Code and Google Colab, uses Python (Flask, Facenet/Pytorch, FAISS Index) and Postman (for API Testing) to return the most similar picture of a person, when the input is a picture of a person whose picture is present in the LFW (Labelled Faces in the Wild) dataset (available on <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/lfw-dataset">Kaggle</a>).<br>
<br>
Potential improvements that I want to implement:
- Using a Vector DB, like Milvus
- Using libraries like Deepface
- Handling multiple persons in an image
- Adding more information for better face matching!
